Implementation of Hierarchical Identity-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism
========================================================

It implements an Hierarchical Identity-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism. The implementation is derived from https://github.com/samkumar/hibe. 

It employs the IBE scheme from [BBG05]. In addition, it is shipped with the PunctureTree algorithm from [GHJL17].
